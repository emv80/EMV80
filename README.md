About Me

As an enthusiastic and dedicated Cybersecurity student, I am committed to upholding ethical standards and trustworthiness. Driven by a passion for Security Engineering, I am committed to creating robust and secure infrastructures. My goal is to become a Security Architect, where I can leverage my skills to identify and analyze risks, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Currently pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, I am gaining expertise in network security, threat detection, and incident response, which will enable me to effectively protect digital assets and respond to security threats.

My diverse professional background—spanning roles as a Mobile Phlebotomist, Health Insurance Sales Agent, and Integrated Customer Support Specialist—has honed my ability to handle sensitive information with integrity, solve complex problems, and manage confidential data. These experiences have uniquely prepared me for a career in cybersecurity, equipping me with strong analytical thinking and technical proficiency. I am eager to apply these skills to enhance security measures, safeguard digital infrastructures, and contribute to effective organizational cybersecurity strategies.
