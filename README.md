About Me

As a highly motivated and dedicated professional with a strong background in adaptability, communication, attention to detail, and analytical problem-solving, I am committed to upholding ethical standards and trustworthiness. My passion for cybersecurity drives me to create secure infrastructures and networks while identifying and analyzing risks to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Currently pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, I am mastering key competencies in network security, threat detection, and incident response, equipping me to protect digital assets and respond effectively to security threats.

My diverse professional background, including roles as a Mobile Phlebotomist, Health Insurance Sales Agent, and Integrated Customer Support Specialist, has uniquely prepared me for a career in cybersecurity. These positions have refined my ability to handle sensitive information with integrity, develop strong problem-solving skills, and manage confidential data effectively. I am eager to apply my analytical thinking, technical proficiency, and commitment to data security to safeguard all people's data, contribute to organizational cybersecurity efforts, safeguard digital infrastructures, and enhance security measures.
